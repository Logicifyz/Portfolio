            <br>
            I first enrolled in Nanyang Polytechnic back in 2022 April through the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP) as a year 0 after scoring an EMB3 of raw 7.
            My PFP year to me was the most enjoyable academic year of my life as I was able to create new connections and learn things in different ways.

            Now in 2023, I am officially enrolled into the Diploma in Information Technology. Though my class has changed, I am still able to meet my PFP friends in school. 
            And I've also made connections with quirky people in my new class.

            A martial arts CCA that I have twice a week on Mondays and Wednesdays. Kickboxing, for me, is not just a sport; 
            it's a way to challenge myself physically and mentally.
            Apart from the physical aspects, kickboxing has taught me the importance of respect, both for my opponents and fellow practitioners. 
            It's an environment that fosters camaraderie and mutual support, which I find truly inspiring.
